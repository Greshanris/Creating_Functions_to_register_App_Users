# Creating_Functions_to_register_App_Users

To run it locally:
- create a virtual python3 environment. Example for linux: ```python3 -m venv myenv```
- activate the virtual environment. Example for linux: ```source /myenv/bin/activate``` 
- Install ipykernel in a virtual environment. Example for linux: ```pip install ipykernel```
- Install the necessary dependency required in the requirements.txt file. All may not be necessary but it was there when I ran ```pip freeze > requirements.txt```
- Another way, is to install through the vscode, changing kernel, and interpreter as the virtual environment one and letting it install necessary dependencies.
